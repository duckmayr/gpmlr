\title{Gaussian Process Inference and Prediction}
\usage{
gp(hyp, inf, mean, cov, lik, x, y, xs, ys)
}
\arguments{
\item{hyp}{A list of length three giving the hyperparameters for the mean,
covariance, and likelihood functions}

\item{inf}{A character vector or list giving the inference method}

\item{mean}{A character vector or list giving the mean function}

\item{cov}{A character vector or list giving the covariance function}

\item{lik}{A character vector or list giving the likelihood function}

\item{x}{A numeric vector or matrix of training inputs}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of training outcomes}

\item{xs}{A numeric vector or matrix of testing inputs}

\item{ys}{A numeric vector of testing outcomes}
}
\value{
A list whose elements depend on the arguments provided to the
  function call:
  \itemize{
      \item If called in training mode, that is, with y, xs, and ys missing,
          the returned list has three elements: NLZ, the negative log
          marginal likelihood, DNLZ, a list of vectors giving the partial
          derivatives of the negative log marginal likelihood with respect
          to the mean, covariance, and likelihood parameters, and POST,
          a list of three elements, alpha, sW, and L, giving a
          representation of the approximate posterior.
      \item If called in prediction mode with xs supplied by ys missing,
          the returned list has five elements: a vector YMU giving the
          predictive output means, a vector YS2 giving the predictive
          output variances, a vector FMU giving the predictive latent means,
          a vector FS2 giving the perdictive latent variances, and POST,
          a list of three elements, alpha, sW, and L, giving a
          representation of the approximate posterior.
      \item If called in prediction mode with all arguments supplied,
          the returned list has six elements: the five elements given when
          ys is missing, as well as a vector LP of logged predictive
          probabilities.

\description{
\code{gp} allows the user to call GPML's Matlab function for Gaussian
process inference and prediction.
}
\details{
GPML provides several inference methods, as well as several mean,
covariance, and likelihood functions to be used in its \code{gp()}
Matlab function. Their detailed manual is available at
\url{http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/manual.pdf}.

\examples{
## This example are given on the GPML website.
## Here's how you can run them from R.
## First consider an example with simple mean and covariance functions:
set.seed(123)
x <- rnorm(20, 0.8, 1)
y <- sin(3 * x) + 0.1 * rnorm(20, 0.9, 1)
xs <- seq(-3, 3, length.out = 61)
hyp <- list(mean = numeric(), cov = c(0, 0), lik = -1)
gp_result <- gp(hyp, "infExact", "", "covSEiso", "likGauss", x, y, xs)
str(gp_result)
plot(xs, gp_result$YMU, type = "l",
     xlab = "x", ylab = "Predictive Output Mean")
}
